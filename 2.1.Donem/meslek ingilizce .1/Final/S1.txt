1- Inside today's computers information is encoded as patterns of Os and 1s. These digits are

called.BITS.

2- To understand how individual bits are stored and manipulated inside a computer, it is convenient to imagine that the bit 0 represents the value.False. and the bit 1 represents the value.True.

3- The operation.NOT. is another Boolean operation. It differs from AND, OR, and XOR because it

has only one input.

4- If the input of the operation NOT is true, then the output is.

.False.and vice versa.

5- The.NOT. gate behaves in the opposite fashion to AND gate. You can think of it as an AND gate followed immediately by a .NOT. gate.

6- .A DATABASE . is a way of defining, storing & retrieving of data in a structural & systematic way.

7- .ALGORITHM .is a step by step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in certain order to get the desired output.

8- .SYSTEM.consists of programs + documentation + operating procedures

9-  .Decision tree.can replace flowcharts.

10- . ALGORITHM .are transformed into actual code or program during the implementation phase

1- Depict a tree which has same preorder and inorder traversal.

2- Depict a tree which has same postorder and inorder traversal.

3. Depict a tree which has same preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal.

4. Explain: "Reverse Engineering" and "Re-Engineering"

5- Write the applications of XOR gate in computer engineering.

6. Which problems can be solved with the tree data model?

7- Which problems can be solved with the graph data model?

8- Which problems can be solved with the state machine data model?

9- Write the differences between arrays and linked lists?

10-Write the definitions of job, task, process, and thread. What are the differences?
